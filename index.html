              <p><Sub>(Scroll down to read more)</Sub><br><br>The birth of the Legion of Mary took place in the heart of
                a young 24 year old dedicated youth who had
                a
                distinguished career in the Civil Services in Dublin, Ireland. This youth, Frank Duff, found great joy
                in
                rendering his services to the needs of the poor and gave vent to this passion by joining the society of
                St. Vincent de Paul.<br><br>On 7th September 1921, on the eve of the feast of the Nativity of our Lady,
                this
                young devotee of our Lady, took courage and began the Lay Apostolic Organization with the sanction of
                the
                Church, which promoted the work of evangelization. Frank Duff along with a group of Catholic women and a
                Priest from Dublin Archdiocese formed the first branch, what we now call Praesidium of The legion of
                Mary.
                Frank Duff’s undertaking was a visible proof of the influence of the Holy Spirit and the exquisite touch
                of Mary’s hand in the birth of this organization. The Legion of Mary found worldwide growth due to Frank
                Duff’s guided and heroic dedication. Frank Duff was invited to attend the Second Vatican council as a
                lay
                observer. His work found favor for him to receive great appreciation and apostolic blessings from the
                then
                Holy Father, Pope John Paul II, who in one of his addresses delivered to a group of Italian Legionaries
                in
                1982 said, “Your proper vocation as lay people is the vocation to be a leaven to the people of God, a
                Christian inspiration in the modern world, and to bring the priest to the people, is eminently
                ecclesial”<br><br>God called Frank Duff to his heavenly abode on 7th Nov 1980, he was 91 years
                then.<br><br>Works
                of Frank Duff did not go unnoticed as the Legion of Mary spread like a fire set ablaze, doing things
                which
                were marveled by the Church.<br><br>In filial dependence on Mary and protected by her maternal love, the
                Legion of Mary took pride in enlisting all her members in the Church's evangelizing works all over the
                world.<br><br>For all you who are inspired and touched by his life and the Charism of the Legion of Mary
                can
                read the official handbook of the legion wherein you will find Frank Duff’s profound insights into the
                role of the Holy Spirit and the Blessed Virgin Mary in the plan of redemption and the role of the lay
                faithful in the mission of the church. This handbook which was his own composition explains in detail
                the
                origin, object, spirit and working of the Association.<br><br>Many great thinkers and readers have found
                vital
                inspiration from this handbook. The Legion of Mary today is found in almost every country in the world
                and
                has nearly three million active members carrying out the work of evangelization and getting many
                auxiliaries. These are the members who support the active members by their prayers.<br><br>Mumbai too
                takes
                pride in being part of this Organization and nearly 121 parishes in the Archdioceses have seen the
                growth
                of the Legion of Mary over the years and its significant contributions in building the Mystical body of
                Christ.</p>

                The spirit of the Legion of Mary is that of Mary herself. Especially does the Legion aspire after her
                profound humility, her perfect obedience, her angelical sweetness, her continual prayer, her universal
                mortification, her altogether spotless purity, her heroic patience, her heavenly wisdom, her
                selfsacrificing courageous love of God, and above all her faith, that virtue which has in her alone been
                found in its utmost extent and never equalled. Inspired by this love and faith of Mary, her Legion
                essays any and every work and complains not of impossibility, because it conceives that it may and can
                do all things.’’ (Imitation of Christ, Book 3 :5)<br><br>“Perfect model of this apostolic spiritual life
                is the Blessed Virgin Mary, Queen of Apostles. While on earth her life was like that of any other,
                filled with labours and the cares of the home; always, however, she remained intimately united to her
                Son and cooperated in an entirely unique way in the Saviour’s work. Everyone should have a genuine
                devotion to her and entrust his life to her motherly care.” (AA 4)

                  role of the Holy Spirit and the Blessed Virgin Mary in the plan of redemption and the role of the lay
                  faithful in the mission of the church. This handbook which was his own composition explains in detail

                  and
                  has nearly three million active members carrying out the work of evangelization and getting many
                  auxiliaries. These are the members who support the active members by their prayers.<br><br>Mumbai too
                  takes
                  pride in being part of this Organization and nearly 121 parishes in the Archdioceses have seen the
                  growth
                  of the Legion of Mary over the years and its significant contributions in building the Mystical body
                  of
                  Christ.</p>

                The spirit of the Legion of Mary is that of Mary herself. Especially does the Legion aspire after her
                profound humility, her perfect obedience, her angelical sweetness, her continual prayer, her universal
                mortification, her altogether spotless purity, her heroic patience, her heavenly wisdom, her
                selfsacrificing courageous love of God, and above all her faith, that virtue which has in her alone been
                found in its utmost extent and never equalled. Inspired by this love and faith of Mary, her Legion
                essays any and every work and complains not of impossibility, because it conceives that it may and can
                do all things.’’ (Imitation of Christ, Book 3 :5)<br><br>“Perfect model of this apostolic spiritual life
                is the Blessed Virgin Mary, Queen of Apostles. While on earth her life was like that of any other,
                filled with labours and the cares of the home; always, however, she remained intimately united to her
                Son and cooperated in an entirely unique way in the Saviour’s work. Everyone should have a genuine
                devotion to her and entrust his life to her motherly care.” (AA 4)

          <div class="lomcon">
            The object of the Legion of Mary is the glory of God through the holiness of its members developed by prayer
            and active co-operation in Mary’s and the Church’s work. The unit of the Legion of Mary is called a
            praesidium, which holds a weekly meeting, where prayer is intermingled with reports and discussion. Persons
            who wish to join the Legion must apply for membership in a Praesidium. The Legion sees as its priority the
            spiritual and social welfare of each individual. The members participate in the life of the parish through
            visitation of families, the sick, both in their homes and in hospitals and through collaboration in every
            apostolic and missionary undertaking sponsored by the parish. Every legionary is required to carry out a
            weekly apostolic work in the spirit of faith and in union with Mary.<br><br>The Legion of Mary is a lay
            apostolic association of Catholics who, with the sanction of the Church and
            under the powerful leadership of Mary Immaculate, Mediatrix of All Graces, serve the Church and their
            neighbour on a voluntary basis in about 170 countries. The first meeting of the Legion of Mary took place in
            Myra House, Francis Street, Dublin, Ireland, on 7 September, 1921. This meeting was to have very beneficial
            consequences for the mission of the Catholic Church and, in a special way, for millions of members of
            Christ’s lay faithful who would serve in the Legion and for those who would be served by the legionary
            apostolate. Many persons outside the Catholic Church would also benefit from that apostolate. With the
            approval and support of the Popes and a great many Bishops, Priests and Religious, as well as the prayers
            and efforts of legionaries, the Legion, by the grace of God, has grown into a worldwide organisation with
            several million members.<br><br>Drawing its inspiration from the True Devotion to Mary, as taught by St.
            Louis Marie de Montfort, and which
            had a profound influence on the Founder of the Legion, the Servant of God, Frank Duff, the Legion is at the
            disposal of the Bishops and Priests for use in the mission of the Church. While essentially a lay
            association, legionaries look for spiritual and apostolic formation to priests and religious, who, as Legion
            Spiritual Directors, hold an honoured place in the Legion system. The Legion requires ecclesiastical
            approval to work in a diocese or parish. Loyalty to the Magisterium and to Ecclesiastical Authority is a
            basic legionary principle. The Legion aims to bring Mary to the world as the infallible means of winning the
            world to Jesus and legionary service is based on the doctrine of the Mystical Body of Christ so that in
            their fellow members and in those they serve, legionaries seek to have the Person of our Lord once again
            seen and served by Mary, his Mother.<br><br>The general and essential means by which the Legion of Mary is
            to effect its object is personal service
            acting under the influence of the Holy Spirit, having Divine Grace as its moving principle and support, and
            the glory of God and the salvation of souls as its final end and purpose. Evangelisation, especially the
            seeking of conversions to the Church, should be a priority for the Legion. Through the visitation of homes
            and by other means, the Legion must, as a first principle, set out to establish a contact of some sort with
            every soul everywhere. Seeing and serving Christ in the sick and marginalised is another vital part of the
            legionary apostolate. While not engaging in the giving of material relief, legionaries will often find
            opportunities to do works of service for the needy.<br><br>The basic unit of the Legion is called a
            praesidium, which is normally based in a parish. A parish may have
            more than one praesidium. To be an active legionary it is necessary to apply for membership in a praesidium,
            which holds a weekly meeting and allocates a weekly apostolic task to the members, who generally work in
            pairs. After a successful period of probation, members are called to make the Legionary Promise (this is
            only applicable for members over 18 years) which is directed to the Holy Spirit. Realising the necessity for
            a strong support of prayer, the Legion has Auxiliary members, who associate themselves with the Legion by
            undertaking a service of prayer in its name. The administration of the Legion is carried out through its
            various councils at local, regional and national level. The central council, the Concilium Legionis Mariae,
            meets monthly in Dublin.<br><br>The Cause for Beatification has been introduced for three legionaries: The
            Servant of God, Frank Duff
            (1889-1980), Founder of the Legion, who attended the Second Vatican Council as a Lay Observer; Venerable
            Edel Quinn (1907-1944), Legion Envoy to East Africa; and the Servant of God, Alfie Lambe (1932-1959), Legion
            Envoy to South America.

          <div class="lomhead2">Structure</div>
          <div class="lomcon2">The organization of the Legion is modeled on the Roman Army, starting with the praesidium
            as its smallest
            unit,
            and going up from there. The praesidium, usually a group of 4-20 members, meets weekly in its parish. The
            Curia
            is the next level up, and one Curia supervises several Praesidia. The next level is the Comitium, which is
            in
            charge of several Curiae, usually over an area like a big city or a part of a province. The following level
            is
            the Regia, in charge of larger territories like a province or state (in the U.S.). The Senatus is the next
            highest level, and it generally has control over the Regiae in a very large area, usually a country or very
            large territory. The Concilium is the highest level. It has its seat in Dublin, Ireland, and has control
            over
            all of the Legion. Each level of the Legion of Mary has the same officers: The President, the Vice
            President,
            the Secretary, the Treasurer, and the Spiritual director. The latter must be a priest or a religious. All
            other
            offices are held by laymen or -women.</div>
          <div class="lomhead3">Membership</div>
          <div class="lomcon3">Membership is open to all baptized Catholics. After visiting a praesidium a few times,
            one can join the
            legion
            as a probationary member. This probationary membership lasts for three months, after which he or she has to
            decide whether to join the Legion as an active member permanently. During the probationary period,
            probationary
            members learn about the legion system by reading the Handbook of the Legion of Mary and its active works by
            listening to reports of active works undertaken by fellow legionaries. At the end of probationary period,
            members say an oath of "Legion promise", a pledge of allegiance to the Holy Spirit and to Mary, in order to
            become a permanent active member. Membership in the Legion of Mary is essentially based on discipline and
            commitment. Members devote their time and prayer for the intentions of Mary, Mother of God. Members can
            withdraw
            from the Legion by informing the president of his or her praesidium.</div>

                in
                active apostolate for the Legion and the Church. Active members under the age of 18 are not allowed to

                the
                "Legion promise" until they turn 18. Members 18 and under are considered Juniors, and are able to hold

                Adjutorians, a higher grade of auxiliary membership, additionally pray the Divine Office and go to Holy
                Mass daily.

                Praetorians and Adjutors do not have higher status or higher rank inside the legion system. The meaning
                of the grades is only a desire for a more devotional life, not for higher status. Entering the grade is
                done by registering with a list of Praetorians/Adjutors and by subsequently observing their duties.</p>

        <h2>Altar of the Legion of Mary</h2>
        The praesidia of the Legion normally meet weekly, larger entities normally monthly or at even rarer occasions.
        For all sessions, the Altar of the Legion is set up. This consists of a statue of the Virgin Mary (represented
        as a modestly dressed, humble, pure, and holy woman standing on a globe, her arms extended, crushing the serpent
        with her foot) that is placed on a white tablecloth that has "Legio Mariae" written on it. On the two sides of
        the statue are placed two vases with flowers, often roses (the flower connected with Mary). On the front ends of
        the cloth stand two candlesticks with burning candles. On the right side of Mary, the vexillium Legionis
        (standard of the Legion) is placed. It is made out of metal and onyx and shows the Holy Spirit in the form of a
        dove, as well as the Miraculous Medal. During the meetings, all prayers of the Tessera are said. The sessions
        start out with the introductory prayers to the Holy Spirit and Mary. These include five decades of the Rosary.
        The following part of the session includes a spiritual reading and administrative matters. Each member tells in
        short words how he or she has fulfilled their tasks assigned to them at the previous session. They also discuss
        and/or read a chapter from the Handbook of the Legion. Then the Catena Legionis is prayed, afterwards the
        Spiritual director or (if he is absent) the President holds a short sermon about spiritual matters (allocutio).
        Finally, the new tasks for the legionaries are distributed. Each meeting ends with the concluding prayers of the
        Tessera and a prayer for Frank Duff's beatification.



        · Spirituality
        The spirituality of the Legion of Mary is essentially based on the approach of St. Louis-Marie Grignon de
        Montfort as put forward in his book True Devotion to Mary. Grignion de Montfort promoted a "total dedication" to
        Christ through devotion to the Blessed Virgin Mary, which later also influenced popes such as John Paul II, as
        mentioned in his Apostolic Letter Rosarium Virginis Mariae. Another important element that shaped Legion
        spirituality was Frank Duff's devotion to the Holy Spirit. He promoted the (in popular devotion often neglected)
        adoration of the Third Person of the Trinity through the Virgin Mary, whom he saw as the "visible image" of the
        Spirit. This is why the introductory prayers and the Legion promise are directed to the Holy Spirit and the
        vexillium Legionis bears its image in the form of a dove.

        The essential aim of the Legion of Mary is the sanctification of its members through prayer, the sacraments and
        devotion to Mary and the Trinity, and of the whole world through the apostolate of the Legion. The idea of an
        organization where ordinary laypeople in all situations of life would work for their own sanctification and for
        the conversion of the world was groundbreaking for its time. Only when the Second Vatican Council (1962: 65)
        promoted such ideas in its documents did such an approach gain wider acceptance in the Catholic Church.
